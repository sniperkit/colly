In a repository path...

See more [here](https://asciinema.org/a/8863)

## Requirements 
- Go  
- cmake  

## Install
- `go get -u -d github.com/cloudson/gitql`
- `cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudson/gitql`
- `make`
- `sudo make install`


## Examples 

`gitql "your query" `   
or   
`git ql "your query" `


As an example, this is the `commits` table:

| commits |
| ---------|
| author |
| author_email |
| committer |
| committer_email |
| hash |
| date |
| message |
| full_message |

(see more tables [here](tables.md))

## Example Commands
* `select hash, author, message from commits limit 3`  
* `select hash, message from commits where 'hell' in full_message or 'Fuck' in full_message`  
* `select hash, message, author_email from commits where author = 'cloudson'`  
* `select date, message from commits where date < '2014-04-10' `  
* `select message from commits where 'hell' in message order by date asc`

## Questions?

Notes:
* Gitql doesn't want to _kill_ `git log` - it was created just for science! :sweat_smile:
* It's read-only - no deleting, inserting, or updating tables or commits. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
* The default limit is 10 rows.
* It's inspired by [textql](https://github.com/dinedal/textql).
* Gitql is a compiler/interpreter instead of just read a sqlite database with all commits, tags, etc. because we would need to sync the tables every time before run sql and we would have sqlite bases for each repository. :neutral_face:
